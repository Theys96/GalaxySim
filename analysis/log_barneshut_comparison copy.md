This is a log of program runs for an analysis between the iterateEuler and iterateBarnesHut methods.

For most runs, 500 frames are generated and the average computation time for updating the universe state with the selected method is to be recorded. At higher n, fewer frames may be generated to keep the total computation time feasible.
