Specifications:
	n = 1000
	image dimensions = 800x800
	frames = 500

Done.
Time used rendering images and saving them to file:
	44.340s total for 500 frames
	88.680ms on average

Time used updating the universe state:
	6.593s total for 500 frames
	13.187ms on average

```

Clearly, improving the rendering/saving efficiency would yield the greatest performance gain currently.
